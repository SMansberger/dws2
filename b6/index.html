        <h1>Dexmedetomidine</h1>
        <p>Dexmedetomidine (trade names Precedex [US market], Dexdor, Dexdomitor) is a sedative medication used by intensive care units and anesthesiologists. It is relatively unusual in its ability to provide sedation without causing respiratory depression. Like clonidine, it is an agonist of α2-adrenergic receptors in certain parts of the brain. It is the S-enantiomer of medetomidine, used in veterinary medicine. Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride is also used in veterinary medicine for use in dogs and cats. The drug was developed by Orion Pharma.</p>

        <h3>Indications</h3>
        <p>Dexmedetomidine is indicated for sedation of critically ill or injured patients in an intensive care unit setting. Its indication in the US was recently expanded to include nonintubated patient requiring sedation for surgery or procedures short-term. It is also useful as an adjunct for sedation and general anesthesia in the setting of certain operations and invasive medical procedures, such as colonoscopy. There are no absolute contraindications to the use of dexmedetomidine. Limiting its usefulness is the caution that the drug cannot be bolused due to concerns about peripheral α2-receptor stimulation with resulting hypotension and bradycardia, combined with its current high cost relative to generic medications such as propofol, fentanyl and midazolam which can achieve similar clinical effects.</p>
